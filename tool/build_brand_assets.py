"""Render the Wyss Center logo into every raster the app and the docs need.

Run by hand and commit the output, the same way the launcher icons are handled:

    uv run --no-project --with pymupdf --with pillow \\
        python tool/build_brand_assets.py

`assets/brand/*.svg` are the masters. Everything under `assets/icon/` and the
docs logo and favicons are generated from them, so the mark is never traced by
hand and the two never drift.

Only the black master is rasterised. Its ink coverage becomes an alpha mask and
the colour is painted through it, so a white or tinted variant needs no second
render and cannot disagree with the black one about geometry. It also avoids
depending on how the renderer resolves the CSS class that carries the fill.

PyMuPDF ships a prebuilt wheel and reads SVG directly. cairosvg and reportlab's
renderPM both need libcairo, which is absent on Windows, and neither
ImageMagick nor Inkscape is installed.
