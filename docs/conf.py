"""Sphinx configuration for the DBS Annotator documentation.

The application is written in Dart, so nothing here imports the software. Two
consequences:

* Read the Docs installs only ``docs/requirements.txt``, with no project
  install and no system libraries.
* ``autodoc``, ``autosummary``, ``napoleon`` and ``viewcode`` are absent because
  they would have no target. A Dart API reference via ``dartdoc`` is a separate
  decision.
