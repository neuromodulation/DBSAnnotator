Reports and datasets
====================

Upload the TSVs you have, or load them from a BIDS dataset, then take whatever
they support. This screen never changes the files you give it: it reads them,
shows what is in them, and produces documents and datasets from them. Into a
dataset you choose it writes only what you ask it to add, and only after you
have confirmed the list of files.

The whole screen scrolls as one page, from the upload buttons down through the
actions to the preview, so a long session table never squeezes the rest.

From the home screen: two visits uploaded, the longitudinal report's sections
chosen, the scale targets it ranks by, then the export.

   Before anything is uploaded. Every action is listed, disabled, with the
   reason underneath rather than hidden until you tap it.

Uploading
---------

**Upload TSVs** takes several files at once. Each is classified by its
**columns**, not its name, so a file renamed by hand still opens as what it is,
and a file that is neither a programming session nor a notes file is rejected by
name rather than loaded as a screen of blank rows.

A file already in the list is refused by name. Two files with the same basename
would collide in a BIDS dataset and would be double-counted in a combined table,
so the duplicate is dropped rather than silently merged.

.. _load-from-dataset:

Loading from a dataset
----------------------

When your visits are already filed in a BIDS dataset, **Load from dataset** reads
them from there instead of one upload at a time. On Windows, macOS and Linux you
choose the dataset folder; on iPadOS and Android you choose the dataset as a
``.zip``, because those systems do not let an app read a folder you pick.

Every session and notes TSV under ``sub-<participant>/ses-<session>/beh/`` is
found, including older ``_events.tsv`` files. Sidecars, imaging, other datatypes
and everything under ``derivatives/`` are left alone. A checklist then shows each
participant with the number of files found, all ticked: untick the ones you do
not want, for example to keep a longitudinal report to one patient.

   :alt: The checklist of participants found in the dataset, all ticked, with
         the number of files for each
   :width: 42%
   :align: center

The chosen
files join the list exactly as if you had uploaded them, so every action below
works the same way, and a single file can still be removed.

What each upload enables
------------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 34 66

   * - Action
     - Available when
   * - Single session report
     - Exactly **one** uploaded TSV: a session, or a notes file on its own
   * - Longitudinal report
     - Two or more TSVs **naming the same patient**. A notes file counts, so a
       session and its notes file give a longitudinal report
   * - Combined table (TSV)
     - Two or more TSVs, of any patients. Notes files count
   * - Create a BIDS dataset (zip)
     - At least one file whose name carries a ``sub-`` entity
   * - Add to an existing dataset
     - As above

An action that is unavailable is greyed out **and says why**, in place of its
description.

Every action has an info button beside its name. It opens a short explanation
in three parts: how the export is made, which data it needs, and which files it
creates. The button works on a greyed-out action too, so you can see what that
action would need before uploading anything.

.. figure:: ../_static/screenshots/reports_one_session.png
   :alt: One session uploaded: the single session report and BIDS dataset are
         available, the longitudinal report and combined table are not
   :width: 100%

   One session. The report and a dataset are available; the longitudinal report
   and the combined table need more than one file.

Filing a single session into a dataset
--------------------------------------

The single session report row also offers **Add to dataset**, when the file
name carries BIDS entities (``sub-`` and ``ses-``). A dialog asks what to file:

* **Session TSV and sidecar**, ticked by default, goes to
  ``sub-<participant>/ses-<session>/beh/`` exactly as
  :ref:`Add to an existing dataset <dataset-merge-rules>` would place it.
* **Report**, unticked by default, as PDF or Word. It goes under
  ``derivatives/dbs-annotator-reports/``, at the same
  ``sub-<participant>/ses-<session>/beh/`` path as its session, named like the
  exported report. The derivative's ``dataset_description.json`` is written the
  first time a report is filed there.

You then choose the dataset folder (on iPadOS and Android, the dataset as a
``.zip``, which comes back merged), and the same confirmation as every other
add lists each file before anything is written. A report already filed at that
path is refused, never overwritten. If the session was moved to the next free
run because its name was taken, the report follows it to that run.

Several visits of one patient
-----------------------------

With two or more sessions naming the same patient, every action is available and
the preview becomes the scales timeline across all of them.

   :alt: Several visits uploaded, with the scales timeline across all of them
   :width: 100%

Different patients
------------------

If the uploaded files name more than one patient, the screen says so and the
longitudinal report stays off. Combining two people into one longitudinal report
is a safety problem, not a formatting one. A combined table and a BIDS dataset
across several patients are ordinary things to want, so those stay available.

   :alt: Two patients uploaded: a warning banner, and the longitudinal report
         disabled with its reason
   :width: 100%

Notes alongside a session
-------------------------

A ``task-notes`` file uploaded together with a session makes two files, so it
gives a **longitudinal report**, with the data aggregated as for any set of
visits. Each note joins the session table of the visit on its own day (when two
sessions share a day, the one under way at the note's time), placed by its own
clock time with only the Time and Notes cells filled. A note from **any other
day**, a follow-up call a week later for example, is not slipped into a visit's
table: placed by clock time alone it would read as part of a visit it did not
happen in. Those notes are listed after the Visits table under **Notes on days
without a session**, each with its full date and time. The per-visit session
tables are the **Combined session data table** section, which is off by
default; tick it in the section chooser to see the notes recorded during each
visit.

Two or more notes files with no session also give a longitudinal report. It has
no visits, so it says that no session TSV was uploaded and lists every note by
date.

The notes must name the same patient as the sessions. If they do not, the
longitudinal report is greyed out with the reason.

It gets its own row rather than being written into a block's Notes cell,
because a note carries no configuration: attaching it to one would assert it was
recorded against stimulation settings the file never says it was. A note with no
readable timestamp is left out, since there is nowhere on a time axis to put it.

Adding to a dataset you already have
------------------------------------

**Add to an existing dataset** folds the uploaded files into a BIDS dataset you
already have, rather than producing a separate one to reconcile by hand. It
offers both ways of doing that, so the choice is yours:

* **Add** writes into the folder you choose. Available on Windows, macOS and
  Linux; iPadOS and Android do not let an app write into a folder you pick, so
  the button is disabled there and says why.
* **Export** takes the dataset as a zip and gives a merged zip back, leaving the
  original untouched. Available everywhere, and the safe way to see what a merge
  produces before letting it near the real thing.

.. _bids-folder-requirements:

**What counts as a BIDS dataset.** The folder (or the top level of the zip) must
hold a ``dataset_description.json``, with one ``sub-<participant>`` folder per
participant listed in ``participants.tsv``. If the folder you pick is empty, the
app offers to start a new dataset there, writing its
``dataset_description.json``, ``README`` and ``participants.tsv`` along with the
first visit. A folder with other content and no ``dataset_description.json`` is
refused, with this explanation, so BIDS files are never scattered through a
folder that is not a dataset.

   :alt: The refusal for a folder that is not a BIDS dataset

**How a visit is added.** Each visit goes to
``sub-<participant>/ses-<session>/beh/`` as a ``_beh.tsv`` with its ``.json``
sidecar. Its participant gets a row in ``participants.tsv`` and the visit a row in
that session's ``sub-<participant>_ses-<session>_scans.tsv``. Nothing already in
the dataset is changed.

**Nothing is written until you have seen what will happen.** Every Add opens a
dialog that restates how the visit is added and lists every file that will be
added, every index file that will gain rows, any file moved to the next free
run, and everything left unchanged. This is the only operation in the app that writes to data it
did not create, and it has no undo.

   :alt: The confirmation before adding: how visits are added, and the files added, gaining rows and left unchanged

.. _dataset-merge-rules:

The rules it follows, and why each one exists:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 34 66

   * - Files
     - What happens
   * - ``dataset_description.json``, ``README``, ``participants.json``
     - Written only if missing. Yours carry the study's authors, licence and
       DOI; the app's would replace them with a generated stub.
   * - ``participants.tsv``, ``*_scans.tsv``
     - Unioned, never replaced. Every column you have is kept, so ``age``,
       ``sex`` or ``diagnosis`` survive, and a new subject is appended with
       those cells empty.
   * - ``sub-*/ses-*/beh/*``
     - Added only, never overwritten. A file whose name the dataset already
       uses for a different recording is filed under the next free run
       (``run-02``, ``run-03``) and listed as such, so any number of recordings
       per session can be added. A file identical to one already there is
       left as it is.
   * - Everything else
     - Untouched. Other datatypes, derivatives and anything you keep alongside
       are never even read.

Merging the same files twice does nothing the second time.

A zip merge is refused above 200 MB, since a dataset carrying imaging does not
fit in an iPad's or Android device's memory. Adding into a folder on Windows,
macOS or Linux has no such limit.

Exporting
---------

Reports offer **PDF** or **Word**. Both report kinds show the
:ref:`report sections <dialog-report-sections>` dialog first, with
:ref:`scale targets <dialog-scale-targets>` reachable from inside it. For a
notes file every section applies, so the dialog is skipped.

.. figure:: ../_static/screenshots/dialog_longitudinal_sections.png
   :alt: The longitudinal report sections dialog, with its seven sections
   :width: 44%
   :align: center

The longitudinal chooser offers seven sections. Three of them start unticked,
because they add pages:

* **Combined session data table** prints every configuration of every visit,
  one table per visit under its own heading.
* **Electrode configuration** draws four lead diagrams per visit, so six visits
  is roughly a page and a half of images.
* **Programming summary** gives the parameters used at each visit.

Scale targets do two things here. They mark the two best configurations
across **all** visits together, banded in the session-scales figure and shaded in
the per-visit tables, and they fix the y axis to the declared range instead of
fitting it to the data, so a scale sits on the same axis at every visit and a
drop between visits is a drop rather than a rescale. The ranking is meaningful
across visits because every visit's index is computed against the same targets
and declared ranges. The clinical figure carries no bands.

A TSV does not store scale targets, so the longitudinal export asks for them.
When a notes file is uploaded, **Combined session data table** starts ticked,
since that is where notes from a visit day are printed. The clinical figure's
axis takes each scale's range from your :ref:`clinical scales settings
<dialog-clinical-scales>`, because a TSV records scores but not ranges.

Every report export ends by asking, optionally, who recorded the session and,
for the session and longitudinal reports, who rated the scales, for the
attestation block. The names are not saved anywhere else.

A report is named from its source file's own BIDS entities with the data suffix
replaced by ``_report``, so the two sort together in a directory listing:

.. code-block:: text

   sub-01_ses-20260203_task-programming_run-01_beh.tsv
   sub-01_ses-20260203_task-programming_run-01_report.pdf

A file whose name carries no ``sub-`` entity keeps its own stem rather than
having one invented for it: a wrong subject label on a clinical document is
worse than an unhelpful filename.

The longitudinal report spans visits, so it carries no ``ses-`` and no
``task-``; ``desc-`` is the BIDS entity for naming what a computed file is:

.. code-block:: text

   sub-01_desc-longitudinal_report.pdf

See :doc:`../reports` for what each document contains, and
:ref:`the combined table <combined-table>` for what the aggregated TSV holds.

The combined table
------------------

Every uploaded file goes into the combined table. A notes file adds one row
per note, with its time and text; the stimulation and scale columns of those
rows are ``n/a``.

The combined table always comes with its ``.json`` sidecar, which documents the
four key columns and every session column, so the table can be read without this
documentation at hand.

When every session in the list was :ref:`loaded from a dataset folder
<load-from-dataset>`, **Export** saves the table into that dataset first, where
BIDS puts a table that spans sessions:

.. code-block:: text

   derivatives/dbs-annotator-aggregate/
       dataset_description.json
       desc-aggregate_beh.tsv
       desc-aggregate_beh.json

The folder's ``dataset_description.json`` marks it as a derivative and names the
app that produced it; it is written once and never replaced. The table itself is
regenerated from the raw files, so exporting again replaces it, and the previous
version is kept beside it with a ``.bak-`` suffix. Nothing in the raw
``sub-*`` tree is written. The app then asks whether to save a copy somewhere
else too, as a ``.zip`` holding the table and its sidecar.

If the list mixes files from the dataset with files uploaded from elsewhere, or
the dataset was loaded as a ``.zip``, nothing is written into the dataset and the
table and sidecar are exported as a ``.zip`` as usual.
