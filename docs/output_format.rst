Data files (TSV and BIDS)
=========================

Everything the app records is written as **tab-separated text**, with a JSON
sidecar beside it describing every column. There is no proprietary container, no
binary blob and no export step that can silently drop a field: what you see in
the file is what was recorded.

Filenames
---------

Filenames follow the `BIDS <https://bids.neuroimaging.io/>`_ entity convention:

.. code-block:: text

   sub-<subject>_ses-<YYYYMMDD>_task-<task>_run-<NN>_beh.tsv
   sub-<subject>_ses-<YYYYMMDD>_task-<task>_run-<NN>_beh.json

with two task values:

``task-programming``
   A full session: stimulation parameters and scale ratings per configuration.

``task-notes``
   An annotations-only session: timestamped free text, nothing else.

For example:

.. code-block:: text

   sub-01_ses-20260203_task-programming_run-01_beh.tsv
   sub-01_ses-20260203_task-notes_run-01_beh.tsv

``run`` distinguishes several sessions on the same day and defaults to ``01``. It
is an *index*, so it is reduced to digits and zero-padded. The subject label is
sanitised to alphanumerics, so a typed ``/`` or ``..`` cannot escape into the
path.

.. note::

   Older files end in ``_events.tsv`` and spell three of their columns
   ``block_ID``, ``session_ID`` and ``program_ID``. They open unchanged,
   because the app reads a file's kind from its columns rather than from its
   name. See :ref:`the naming rules <bids-changes>` for where the current
   spellings come from.

Row shape
---------

The session file is in **long form: one row per (block, scale)**.

A *block* is one stimulation configuration. If five scales are rated at a
configuration, that block contributes five rows, and each of them repeats that
block's stimulation values. This is deliberate, and it is the single most
important thing to understand about the format:

.. include:: _generated/example_rows.inc.rst

.. _why-long-not-wide:

Why long and not wide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One row per block with a column per scale looks tidier and is worse. The column
set becomes indication-specific, because an OCD session and a Parkinson's
session rate different things, so pooling the two needs an outer join on
mismatched headers, and adding a scale mid-study changes the header of every
file written from then on.

In long form, a site using different scales simply writes different *rows*, and
everything pools with a concatenation. It is also the shape that pivots without
reshaping:

.. code-block:: python

   import pandas as pd

   df = pd.read_csv(path, sep="\t", na_values=["n/a"])
   wide = df.pivot_table(
       index=["append_id", "block_id"],
       columns="scale_name",
       values="scale_value",
   )

Which rows are which
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``is_initial`` separates the two kinds of entry:

``is_initial = 1``
   The **baseline** block: the clinical assessment and the settings the patient
   arrived on, recorded before any configuration is tried. Excluded from
   "configurations tested" and from the tested-parameter ranges in reports.

``is_initial = 0``
   A **recording** block: one configuration that was tried and rated.

.. warning::

   Read ``is_initial`` numerically, not as a truthy string. Some files write
   ``0.0``/``1.0``, and ``df.is_initial.astype(bool)`` is ``True`` for the
   *string* ``"0.0"``, which silently moves the baseline into the tested set.
   Use ``df.is_initial.astype(float).eq(1)``.

Omitted ratings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A scale that was not assessed at a block is written as ``n/a``, which is what
BIDS requires for a missing or non-applicable value. Read it with:

.. code-block:: python

   df = pd.read_csv(path, sep="\t", na_values=["n/a", "NaN"])

``NaN`` is there because older files spell it that way.

Timestamps
----------

Every row carries **one** time cell:

.. code-block:: python

   df["when"] = pd.to_datetime(df.acq_time)   # tz-aware, ISO-8601, one line

``acq_time`` is the whole instant with its UTC offset
(``2026-02-03T09:00:00+00:00``), and it is BIDS' own name for a timestamp
column, used in ``scans.tsv`` and ``sessions.tsv``.

One cell rather than four is a deliberate choice. Spreading an instant across
``date``, ``time`` and ``timezone`` cells lets them disagree with each other
while nothing in the file asserts that they agree, and a zone *name* is not
reproducible: Dart reports the same zone as ``W. Europe Daylight Time`` on
Windows and as ``CEST`` on Linux, so one clinic would emit different cells
depending on which platform it recorded the visit on. The only
machine-readable part of a zone name is the offset, and that is already inside
``acq_time``.

.. note::

   Older files store the timestamp as ``date`` + ``time`` plus a ``timezone``
   cell holding a platform-supplied display name, such as the Windows spelling
   ``W. Europe Daylight Time +0200``, which no date parser accepts. **You do
   not need to handle that.** Open such a file in DBS Annotator and export it:
   the app composes ``acq_time`` out of those three cells as it reads them,
   offset included, and writes back only ``acq_time``.

   If you are reading an old file directly with pandas rather than through the
   app, the equivalent is:

   .. code-block:: python

      when = pd.to_datetime(df.date + " " + df.time)
      offset = df.timezone.str.extract(r"([+-]\d{4})")[0]

   which is the two-line, regex-requiring reconstruction that a single
   ``acq_time`` column spares you.

.. warning::

   ``acq_time`` is an *instant*, and rendering an instant picks a timezone. A
   block recorded at ``09:00:00+01:00`` in Geneva is ``03:00`` in Chicago: the
   same moment on a different clock. If you want the time the event happened
   **at the clinic**, read the wall clock out of the string rather than
   localising it:

   .. code-block:: python

      # the clinic's own clock, whatever timezone you are reading in
      clinic_time = df.acq_time.str.slice(11, 19)

      # the instant, for ordering and for measuring intervals
      when = pd.to_datetime(df.acq_time)

   The app makes the same distinction internally: reports and tables print the
   recorded wall clock, while sorting and interval arithmetic use the instant.

Amplitudes and current steering
-------------------------------

``left_amplitude`` and ``right_amplitude`` hold either a single value
(``4.5``) or, when current is shared across several cathodes, the per-contact
values joined by an underscore in cathode order:

.. code-block:: text

   left_cathode     E2b_E2c
   left_amplitude   3.3_2.2      -> 5.5 mA total, 60 % / 40 %

The split is part of the configuration, not a detail: ``3.3_2.2`` and
``2.2_3.3`` across the same two contacts stimulate different tissue. To recover
the delivered dose:

.. code-block:: python

   total = df.left_amplitude.astype(str).str.split("_").apply(
       lambda parts: sum(float(p) for p in parts if p)
   )

Contacts are written in the app's token grammar: ``case`` for the can, ``E2``
for a ring contact, ``E2b`` for one segment of a segmented level, and ``_`` to
join several. ``E2b_E2c`` therefore means two segments of level 2 are active.

This grammar is documented in the JSON sidecar as well as here, because the
sidecar is where a downstream tool will look.

Session columns
---------------

.. include:: _generated/session_columns.inc.rst

Annotations columns
-------------------

.. include:: _generated/annotation_columns.inc.rst

The JSON sidecar
----------------

Every TSV is written with a ``_beh.json`` beside it, carrying one entry per
column with a ``LongName``, a ``Description`` and, where the column has a
physical unit, ``Units``. It is generated from the same contract as the tables
above, so the two cannot disagree.

.. include:: _generated/sidecar_example.inc.rst

The full sidecar carries one such entry per column in the tables above.

.. _bids-relationship:

Relationship to BIDS
--------------------

These files are BIDS files, not merely BIDS-*named*: the entities in the
filename, the datatype directory, the suffix and the sidecar are all what the
specification asks for. The distinction is worth spelling out, because a
filename that looks like BIDS on a file the specification would reject is worse
than no BIDS naming at all. Downstream tools trust the name.

.. _bids-changes:

Why the suffix is ``_beh``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``_events.tsv`` is a reserved suffix with mandatory content. The specification
requires ``onset`` as its first column and ``duration`` as its second, and states
that "each ``events.tsv`` file REQUIRES at least one corresponding data file".

A programming session has neither. There is no acquisition to measure an onset
from, and no imaging or electrophysiology recording beside it. The specification
names the correct alternative directly:

   events files that do not include the mandatory ``onset`` and ``duration``
   columns MAY be included, but MUST be labeled ``_beh.tsv`` rather than
   ``_events.tsv``.

So ``_beh.tsv``, in a ``beh/`` datatype directory, is not a compromise: it is
the suffix the specification points at for exactly this shape of file. An
``_events.tsv`` holding these columns is a file no validator accepts, which is
why the app reads that name and never writes it.

The column names follow the same reasoning. BIDS recommends snake_case, so the
columns are ``block_id``, ``append_id`` and ``program_id``; a missing value is
``n/a``, the spelling BIDS reserves for it; the timestamp is one ``acq_time``
cell; and lines end in LF. Files that instead spell those columns ``block_ID``,
``session_ID`` and ``program_ID``, write ``NaN``, split the timestamp across
``date``, ``time`` and ``timezone``, or end their lines in CRLF are read
without conversion.

The one name worth dwelling on is ``append_id``, which is deliberately not
``session_id``. It counts **data-entry episodes within one file**, advancing
each time that file is reopened to add more rows, and it is file-scoped, so
``append_id`` 1 in two different files are unrelated. BIDS uses ``session_id``
for the ``ses-`` label in ``sessions.tsv``, and one name meaning both things
would mislead anyone reading a table that combines several sessions.

.. note::

   Compatibility runs **one way**. DBS Annotator reads the files written by the
   0.4.x desktop application, in every spelling above. What it writes is meant
   for this app and for analysis, and carries no ``session_ID``, ``date``,
   ``time`` or ``timezone``, so that retired desktop application cannot read a
   current file in full. Saying so plainly is better than implying a symmetry
   that does not hold.

.. _bids-dataset-export:

Exporting a dataset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A single file with BIDS entities in its name is still not a BIDS *dataset*. The
specification wants a tree, and **Export → BIDS dataset** produces one as a zip,
from any of the three screens that hold session data:

.. code-block:: text

   dataset_description.json
   README
   participants.tsv
   participants.json
   sub-01/
     ses-20260203/
       sub-01_ses-20260203_scans.tsv
       beh/
         sub-01_ses-20260203_task-programming_run-01_beh.tsv
         sub-01_ses-20260203_task-programming_run-01_beh.json

The reports screen is the useful place to do this: it already holds several
visits of one patient, which is exactly what the ``sub-``/``ses-`` hierarchy is
for, and a file imported under the older ``_events.tsv`` name is re-emitted
into the tree as a valid ``_beh.tsv``.

Reports are derived documents, so they belong under ``derivatives/`` rather than
beside the raw data, and are written there with their own
``dataset_description.json`` rather than being given invented raw-data
filenames.

.. _combined-table:

The combined table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One file per visit is right for recording and awkward for analysis: pooling a
patient's visits, or several patients for a study, means concatenating a folder
of files and losing the one thing that told their rows apart, the filename.

**Combined table (TSV)**, on the reports screen, writes the
imported sessions as one long table with four identity columns prepended:

.. code-block:: text

   participant_id  session_id     run_id  source_file                       ...
   sub-01          ses-20260203   01      sub-01_ses-20260203_..._beh.tsv   ...
   sub-07          ses-20260401   01      sub-07_ses-20260401_..._beh.tsv   ...

The nineteen session columns follow unchanged, which makes twenty-three in
all. So:

.. code-block:: python

   df = pd.read_csv(path, sep="\t", na_values=["n/a"])
   df.groupby(["participant_id", "session_id"]).size()

``participant_id`` uses the BIDS spelling and the BIDS value shape deliberately,
so the table joins onto ``participants.tsv`` with no transformation.

A block is unique across the table on
``(participant_id, session_id, run_id, block_id)``. ``source_file`` is a key
column rather than a convenience: ``run`` defaults to ``01`` and does not
auto-increment, so two visits on the same day can share all three entities
above, and the filename is then the only thing that separates their rows.

.. note::

   ``session_id`` here is the **BIDS session label**, as ``sessions.tsv`` means
   it. The per-file counter is in the table too, under its own name
   ``append_id``: it counts data-entry episodes within one source file, so
   equal values under different ``source_file`` entries are unrelated. That
   possible collision is exactly why the two carry different names; see
   :ref:`the naming rules <bids-changes>`.

Inside a BIDS dataset the same table is a **derivative**, because a table
spanning sessions cannot sit in a tree defined as one file per session:

.. code-block:: text

   derivatives/dbs-annotator-aggregate/
     dataset_description.json     DatasetType: derivative
     desc-aggregate_beh.tsv
     desc-aggregate_beh.json      every column documented

Two things it will not do, and says so rather than doing them quietly: a file
whose name carries no ``sub-`` or ``ses-`` entity is left out and named, because
guessing entities would put a wrong subject label on clinical data; and the same
filename twice is refused rather than concatenated, because duplicate rows
double every count derived from the table with nothing on the face of it to show
why.

Notes files are not combined into this table. Their two columns unioned with the
session file's nineteen would give a frame in which every note row is mostly
empty and ``df.groupby("block_id")`` silently drops all of them.

What is still not standard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The columns themselves. Of the nineteen in a session file, only ``notes`` and
``acq_time`` resemble anything BIDS defines; ``block_id``, ``left_cathode``,
``left_amplitude`` and the rest are this application's own. That is permitted,
since BIDS allows additional columns and asks that they be documented in a
sidecar, which is what the ``_beh.json`` is for, but it does mean no generic
BIDS tool will understand what a *block* is. Read this page, or the sidecar.

The placement of the combined table is the part with the least precedent: a
``desc-``-only filename at a derivative root has no ``sub-`` entity, because the
table deliberately spans subjects. ``desc-`` is the entity BIDS provides for
naming a derivative variant, and dataset-level files do exist, so the shape is
idiomatic; it is checked by a validator job in CI rather than asserted here.

Worked example
--------------

The file used throughout this documentation, and in the app's own test suite, is
**synthetic**. Every rating, stimulation parameter and timestamp in it is
invented, and no recorded session went into it, which is why it can be
published here at all. It is generated by ``tool/generate_fixtures.dart``, whose
comments explain the structure the tests depend on. It describes a visit with a
baseline block, seven configurations tried after it, and five session scales
rated at each:
