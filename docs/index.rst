**Record deep brain stimulation programming visits, and get analysis-ready data
out.**

Once the electrodes are implanted, the patient comes back to see a neurologist or
psychiatrist, who tries stimulation configurations and settles on one that works.
That takes a visit or several, and the parameters go on being adapted over months
or years.

Wyss DBS Annotator documents those visits: the stimulation parameters tried on each
contact, the clinical and session scale ratings at every configuration, side
effects, and free-text notes. They are written to tab-separated files laid out
to :doc:`BIDS <output_format>` (the Brain Imaging Data Structure, a community
standard for organising neuroscience data), so they go straight into analysis. It also produces
clinician-readable :doc:`PDF and Word reports <reports>` for the patient
record. New to the terms? See :doc:`glossary`.

It runs **fully offline**: no account, no server, no telemetry. It is available
for iPadOS, Android, Windows, macOS and Linux, published in each platform's app
store by the Wyss Center for Bio and Neuroengineering. See :doc:`installation`.

.. note::

   This is research software. It documents what was recorded; it does not
   recommend stimulation settings. See :ref:`what-the-reports-do-not-say`.
