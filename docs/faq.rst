Frequently asked questions
==========================

General
-------

**Does it need an internet connection?**
   No, at any point. There is no server component, no account, and no outbound
   connection. It is designed for clinical environments where network access
   cannot be assumed and patient data should not travel.

**Does it send any data anywhere?**
   No. No telemetry, no crash reporting, no analytics. Files go where you save
   them.

**Which leads are supported?**
   Medtronic (3387, 3389, 3391, SenSight B33005/B33015), Boston Scientific
   (Vercise, Vercise Directed, Cartesia HX, Cartesia X), Abbott (ActiveTip,
   Infinity), PINS Medical (L301-L303) and ALEVA directSTIM, including the
   segmented models, whose levels are drawn and tapped as three separate
   segments plus a whole-level ring.

**Can I use it on a phone?**
   Yes. On a narrow screen the two-row steps stack into one column, with more
   scrolling.

Files and data
--------------

**Where are the files saved?**
   Wherever you choose in the platform's file picker or share sheet. While a
   session is open, the app also keeps a working copy in its own storage, for
   crash recovery. When you leave the session you choose whether to keep it or
   discard it. See
   :doc:`privacy`.

**Can I open the TSV in Excel?**
   Yes. It is tab-separated text. Be aware that Excel will try to reinterpret
   some values (a scale name that looks like a date, for instance), so for
   analysis prefer pandas or R, and see :doc:`output_format`.

**Can it open files written by the earlier desktop application (version 0.4)?**
   Yes, with no conversion. Files written by this version are not readable by
   version 0.4. See :ref:`the naming rules <bids-naming>`.

**What happens if the app crashes mid-session?**
   Every insert is written to your file and to the working copy as it happens,
   and an interrupted write leaves the previous version intact rather than a
   truncated file. Reopen the workflow and the app offers the unfinished session
   back. You lose at most the entry you were typing.

**Why is there a row per scale instead of a row per configuration?**
   So that data pools across sites that rate different scales. See
   :ref:`why-long-not-wide`.

Reports
-------

**Why is nothing highlighted green in my report?**
   Because no scale targets have been set, so nothing has been ranked. Set them
   at export, or from the Recording step. See :ref:`scale-targets`.

**Why does the report say "last recorded configuration" rather than "final"?**
   Because the data records only which block came last, not that a clinician
   confirmed a choice. See :ref:`what-the-reports-do-not-say`.

**Can I get the report as a Word file I can edit?**
   Yes. Both formats come from the same numbers, so the ``.docx`` says exactly
   what the PDF does.

Troubleshooting
---------------

**The file picker does not open on Linux.**
   Desktop Linux needs ``zenity`` or ``kdialog`` for native dialogs. Without
   one, exports fall back to saving in a well-known directory and the
   confirmation message names the exact path used.

**Opening a file says it is the wrong kind.**
   The app checks a file's columns before loading it, so an annotations file
   cannot be opened as a session. Use the workflow that matches the file, or
   upload it in *Reports and datasets*, which detects the kind and offers the
   matching report.

**The lead diagram does not match the patient's implant.**
   Check the electrode model. When a file is opened, the app adopts the model
   named inside it and tells you if that name is not in the catalogue.
