# Notes for coding agents

Conventions for any coding agent working in this repository. CONTRIBUTING.md is the full
version for people; this file is the compact one.

## Project

Wyss DBS Annotator is an offline Flutter app for documenting deep brain stimulation
programming sessions, built for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS. The TSV and BIDS
output format is a contract defined in `schema/`, which the app bundles and the docs render
from. User docs are Sphinx sources in `docs/`, published on Read the Docs.

Programming sessions are outpatient visits: the clinicians and the patient sit around a table
while configurations are tested. Write "in clinic" or "during the visit", never "bedside".

## Working rules

- Do not commit, push, tag or open pull requests. The maintainer commits.
- No assistant attribution anywhere: code, docs, commit messages, `Co-Authored-By` trailers.
- Check live state (git, gh, CI) before repeating a status from earlier notes.
- Parallel agents get disjoint sets of files. Stop any agent whose scope overlaps another's,
  since a broad writer silently reverts narrow ones, and re-verify their results yourself.

## Checks

```
dart format lib test integration_test tool
flutter analyze --fatal-infos
flutter test
uvx pre-commit run --all-files
sphinx-build -W docs docs/_build/html
```

`pre-commit run --all-files` sees only tracked files: `git add -N` new files first, and
`git reset` them afterwards if the maintainer stages by hand. Screenshots and docs videos are
generated, never edited by hand; CONTRIBUTING.md has the commands.

## Code style

- Comment only what the code cannot say: a constraint, a non-obvious decision, a defect
  someone would reintroduce. Keep comment lines under about 20% of a file.
- Doc comments on public API are one or two lines. No section headings inside files.
- No version history in code ("used to", "was named"). State the constraint, not the story.
- No em or en dashes anywhere, product strings included. The one exception is the dash key in
  the sanitiser map of `lib/report/report_text.dart`, which must stay. Fix dashes only in lines
  you are already editing.
- Docs prose (`docs/*.rst`) is fuller and explanatory, for a clinician or analyst meeting the
  format for the first time. Still no filler, scattered bold or rhetorical headings.

## Clinical care

Reports are filed in a patient record.

- Never assert what the data does not support.
- Never lose data silently.

## Pitfalls

- Never run `sed -i` over `git ls-files`. With `core.autocrlf` it strips CR bytes from PNG and
  ICO files. Find files with `grep -l` first and check `git diff --numstat` afterwards.
- No `.gitignore` rule may match `lib/`: `git check-ignore -v lib/main.dart` must print
  nothing.
- The contract lives only in `schema/`. Changing a TSV column means changing
  `lib/core/schema_columns.dart` too; `test/schema_columns_test.dart` fails otherwise.
- The version is written in four places, pinned by `test/version_parity_test.dart`.
- `lib/report/` never imports `lib/ui/`.
- Fake-async widget tests cannot finish real file I/O; use `tester.runAsync`.
- Git Bash heredocs mangle `\n` and quotes. Write edit scripts to a file and run that.

## Pointers

- CONTRIBUTING.md: checks, screenshots, videos, review expectations.
- `.github/RELEASING.md`: signing, store submissions, cutting a release.
- `docs/`: user and format documentation.
